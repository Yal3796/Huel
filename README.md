## About The Project

Tasked to make an automation the simulates a user navigating through https://huel.com/ to complete the product quiz and to validate the results given. With my technical coding ability being fairly rusty, I decided to learn typescript and playwright as it's what is currently
being used in the company, as I feel no matter language or framework I used I will be starting close to scratch to begin with.  This in mind, my goal for the set wasn't the prettiest looking code or most glamorous but instead trying to just hit all the given tasks and challenges
presented in the brief. 





### Built With


* Typescript
* Playwright

### Other Findings


* Skip results button appeared once at the product recommendation page, after sometime afk. Which then lead to a 404 Error.  Only encountered this once and tried replicating through numerous attempts.
* Recommendation page Cards - The images shown in the expanded card view through the "Read more" link shows the images used to be either cropped or zoomed in a weird way. Also the expanded cards seems to jolts the main card at certain aspect ratios/window sizes.
